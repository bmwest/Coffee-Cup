# Coffee-Cup
Simulated sips, spills, and refills

* Each instance of a cup is initialized with a desired amount (oz) and the cup's maximum volume.
* You upon each simulation, you are prompted to select a size: tall, grande, venti, trenta, or doppio.
* The sip! method permanently decreases the amount of coffee in your instance of a cup.
* The spill! method permanently empties your instance of a cup.
* The refill! method refills your cup to 2oz less than the cup's maximum volume.

* Open your terminal, and enter ```ruby coffee_cup.rb``` for a simulation.
